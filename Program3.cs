1. What are the six combinations of access modifier keywords and what do they do? 
    Public, Private, Protected, Internal, Protected Internal, Private Protected.
2. What is the difference between the static, const, and readonly keywords when applied to a type member?
    The first, const, is initialized during compile-time and the latter, readonly, initialized is by the latest 
    run-time. 
    The second difference is that readonly can only be initialized at the class-level.
3. What does a constructor do?
    constructor is used to create an object of the class and initialize class members
4. Why is the partial keyword useful?
    The partial keyword indicates that other parts of the class, struct, or interface can be defined 
    in the namespace
5. What is a tuple?
    tuples feature provides concise syntax to group multiple data elements in a lightweight data structure
6. What does the C# record keyword do?
    Records are distinct from classes in that record types use value-based equality. Two variables of a 
    record type are equal if the record type definitions are identical, and if for every field, the values 
    in both records are equal. Two variables of a class type are equal if the objects referred to are the 
    same class type and the variables refer to the same object. 
7. What does overloading and overriding mean?
    overloading is compile time polymorphism
    overriding is rum-time polymorphism
8. What is the difference between a field and a property?
    a field is a variable of any type that is declared directly in the class while property is a member that 
    provides a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the value of a private field
9. How do you make a method parameter optional?
    by parameter keyword
10. What is an interface and how is it different from abstract class?
    An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. 
    An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it.
11. What accessibility level are members of an interface?
    
12. True/False. Polymorphism allows derived classes to provide different implementations of the same method.
    True
13. True/False. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing 
    its own implementation of a method.
    
14. True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own 
    implementation of a method.
15. True/False. Abstract methods can be used in a normal (non-abstract) class. 
16.True/False. Normal (non-abstract) methods can be used in an abstract class. 
17. True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were virtual in the base class. 
18. True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were abstract in the base class. 
19. True/False. In a derived class, you can override a method that was neither virtual non abstract in the 
    base class.
20. True/False. A class that implements an interface does not have to provide an implementation for all 
    of the members of the interface.
21. True/False. A class that implements an interface is allowed to have other members that aren’t defined 
    in the interface.
22. True/False. A class can have more than one base class.
23. True/False. A class can implement more than one interface.
